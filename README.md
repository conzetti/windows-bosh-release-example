Windows BOSH Release Example
============================
ðŸ’¡ _A quick primer on getting started building Windows BOSH releases_

## Getting Started

Fork this repo _or_ initialize your release and git repository with the expected release directory structure
```
bosh init-release --git
```

```yml
releases:
- name: windows-bosh-release-example
  version: 0.0.1-alpha
